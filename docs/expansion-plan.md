# sorcmerc → CRPG expansion — plan

Turns the tactical-combat prototype into a roguelite: build characters on D&D
5.5e rules, form a party, cross a node map (combat / treasure / merchant / rest),
drop into the existing combat screen for fights, carry results back.

## The source

`~/dnd-maintainer` is a 2024 5.5e **campaign manager** (React / TS / Supabase).
Its `src/lib/` is a ~30k-line **grant + resolver engine**: classes / species /
backgrounds / feats emit typed *grants* (hit-die, proficiency, feature,
resource-pool, spell, choice); a resolver materializes a character (HP, AC,
speed, skills, spellcasting, resource pools) from a build + those grants. Data
is in `src/lib/sources/*.ts` and `scripts/data/5e-SRD-*.json`.

It is not a library we can import — it's TS, coupled to React/Zod/Supabase, and
covers 20 levels / multiclassing / hundreds of feats & spells that a small-party
tactical game will never use.

## The fork — how much of D&D to bring over

**A. Full port.** Reimplement the grant/resolver engine in GDScript, extract all
data. Faithful, enormous, most of it dead weight here. Weeks, high risk.

**B. Curated subset.** Extract only the *data we use* to JSON (the classes,
species, spells, gear the game ships with, levels 1–~6), and write a *small*
GDScript character model + level-up chooser that reads it. dnd-maintainer becomes
a data source, not a code dependency. Days–weeks.

**C. Curated subset, extensible schema (recommended).** B, but the exported JSON
schema mirrors dnd-maintainer's grant shape closely enough that adding a class or
raising the level cap later is a data change, not a code change. Same effort as B.

| ID | Sub-project | Owns | Depends on |
|----|-------------|------|------------|
| **F1** | **Data export** — a Node script in dnd-maintainer emitting `sorcmerc/data/{classes,species,backgrounds,feats,skills,weapons,armor,spells}.json` with mechanical fields (hit die, proficiencies, per-level features & resources, spell slots, weapon dice/properties, spell save/damage/shape). | `dnd-maintainer/scripts/export-sorcmerc.mjs`, `sorcmerc/data/*.json` | — |
| **F2** | **Character model** — `core/character.gd` + `core/rules.gd`: abilities, proficiency bonus, skills, class/level, features (a set), resources, inventory; derived AC/HP/init/speed/attacks computed from F1 data. Replaces the ad-hoc fields in `combatant.gd`; a `Character` *is* a `Combatant` for the resolver. | `core/character.gd`, `core/rules.gd`, `core/combatant.gd` | F1 schema |
| **F3** | **Action economy** — real action / bonus / reaction / move per turn in `combat.gd`; feature- and resource-driven verbs (Rage, Action Surge, Sneak Attack, spell slots) sourced from the character's features; conditions from data. | `core/combat.gd`, `core/ai.gd` | F2 |
| **T1** | **Character creator** — Godot scene, steps species → class → abilities (point-buy / standard array) → skills → background → equipment, driven by F1 data; outputs a `character.gd`. | `scenes/creator/*` | F2 |
| **T2** | **Level-up** — given character + target level, surface the choices in F1 data (ASI/feat, subclass at 3, skill/expertise, spells) and apply grants. | `core/leveling.gd`, `scenes/creator/levelup.gd` | F2, F1 |
| **T3** | **Profile manager** — scene: view/edit stats, view/equip inventory, spend/restore resources. | `scenes/profile/*` | F2 |
| **T4** | **Party manager** — a roster (built via T1), pick the active ≤4, shared gold + stash. | `core/party.gd`, `scenes/party/*` | F2 (T1 for the create button) |
| **T5** | **Campaign map** — node graph (start → branching combat/treasure/merchant/rest → boss), party token moves node→node, per-node resolution; combat nodes hand off to the combat scene and await an outcome. | `core/campaign.gd`, `scenes/campaign/*` | T4 |
| **T6** | **Node types** — merchant (buy/sell vs SRD prices), treasure (loot tables), rest (short/long rest recovery). | `core/nodes/*`, `scenes/campaign/*` | T5, F1 |
| **T7** | **Combat ↔ campaign integration** — `encounter.gd` builds an encounter from a spec + the live party instead of hardcoding; combat returns deaths / loot / XP; the combat UI takes party characters. | `core/encounter.gd`, `scenes/main.gd` | F3, T5 |
| **T8** | **Encounter scaler / difficulty** — given the live party (levels, gear, features, resources → a power budget), generate the enemy roster for a node. Difficulty tiers tuned so autopilot party win-rate is ~90% (easy) / ~75% (normal) / ~50% (hard); tune enemy count, HP, AC, to-hit, damage, and kit, verified against the 200-seed sweep in `tests/test_combat.gd`. Must accept a quest-bias hint from T9 (see below). | `core/scaler.gd`, `core/encounter.gd` | F2, F3, T7 |
| **T9** | **Quest system + quest log panel** — see design below. A simple, linear, node-scoped quest layer: a merchant node can offer a kill-count or item-collect quest; later combat nodes on the same route bias their spawns toward an unfulfilled quest's target monster; a quest log panel on the campaign screen shows active/complete quests and progress. | `core/quest.gd`, `core/quest_log.gd`, `scenes/campaign/quest_panel.gd` | T4 (party holds the log), T5 (hosts the panel), T7 (spawn bias hook), T8 (folds the bias into the roster) |

## Realistic phasing (what can actually run in parallel)

1. **F1** — 1 agent. Standalone (a script in the other repo). Defines the schema everything else reads.
2. **F2** — 1 agent. Everything waits on the character model.
3. **F3 · T1 · T3 · T4** — 4 agents in parallel (disjoint files once F2's interface is fixed).
4. **T2 · T5** — 2 agents (T5 after T4).
5. **T6 · T7** — 2 agents.

Not "12 agents now" — the shared character model forces phases 1–2 to be serial.
Each phase ends with a review gate before the next starts.

## Scope decisions (locked 2026-09-10)

- **Port scope: A — full port.** Reimplement the grant + resolver engine in
  GDScript; export dnd-maintainer's entire catalog.
- **Roster: all 12 PHB classes, ~6 species** (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Orc,
  Tiefling), all backgrounds, the full feat & spell catalog dnd-maintainer carries.
- **Level cap: 20** (multiclassing an open question — default single-class unless
  cheap to include).
- **Heroes:** Vera / Pike / Ilsa are rebuilt through the creator as preset builds;
  a new game starts by building your own party.

## T9 design sketch — quests (locked 2026-09-10, kept deliberately simple)

**Quest shape** (`core/quest.gd`, a plain data class, matches the `resolved.gd`/
`grants.gd` style — no inheritance hierarchy for two quest types):
```
id, giver_node_id, title, kind: "kill_count" | "collect_item",
target_monster_id, target_item_id (only for collect_item — the drop the kills yield),
required: int, progress: int, state: "offered" | "active" | "complete" | "turned_in",
reward: {gold: int, item_id: String (optional)}
```
- **kill_count** — progress += 1 per kill of `target_monster_id`, tracked from combat's
  outcome (kill log already exists in `combat.gd`'s log; T7's write-back is where this
  taps in).
- **collect_item** — `target_item_id` drops from `target_monster_id` at a drop chance
  (a new small table, e.g. `data/loot-drops.json`, or a flat rate to start — 50%);
  progress is actual items collected, not kills, so "I killed 5 goblins but only have
  3 ears" is the intended, expected texture, not a bug.

**Offer/turn-in:** merchant nodes (T6) can offer one canned quest from a short curated
list (hand-authored, not procedurally generated — "bring me N goblin ears", "clear N
wolves from the road"); accepting adds it to the party's quest log (`core/party.gd`
gains a `quests: Array` — T4's file, small additive change) in `"active"` state.
Turning in (back at the giver, or a follow-up node) needs `progress >= required`;
pays the reward, sets `"turned_in"`.

**The spawn-bias hook (the part that touches encounter generation):** a node's combat
spec (T7) checks the party's active quests before building its roster; if an active
quest's `target_monster_id` isn't yet fulfilled, the scaler (T8) is told to include
extra copies of that monster in the next 1-2 combat nodes on the route — a bias
weight, not a hard override, so it composes with difficulty tuning rather than
fighting it. `core/scaler.gd` takes an optional `quest_bias: {monster_id: weight}`
parameter; T9 supplies it, T8 just has to honor it.

**Quest log panel** (`scenes/campaign/quest_panel.gd`, part of T5's screen): active
quests with "N/required", complete-but-not-turned-in flagged, a turned-in history
collapsed by default. Programmatic UI, same dark theme as the other new scenes.

**Deliberately not built:** branching dialogue, quest chains/prerequisites, failure
states, timed quests, procedurally generated quest text. If the curated list runs dry
that's a content problem to solve with more entries, not a generator.

## Execution

Phase 0 (now, parallel):
- **F1** — full data export (agent, works in `~/dnd-maintainer`).
- **A0** — GDScript rules-engine architecture spec (agent): how grants / choice
  keys / resolver passes map to GDScript, `Character` vs `Combatant`, the data
  schema F1 must hit. Output: `docs/superpowers/specs/*-rules-engine-design.md`.

Phase 1: **F2** implement the engine against A0 + F1. Review gate.

Phase 2+: F3 / T1 / T3 / T4 parallel, then T2 / T5, then T6 / T7 / T8 — per the
graph above. Each phase gated on review.

### Status log
- 2026-09-10: Phase 0 dispatched — F1 (data export) and A0 (engine architecture
  spec) running as parallel background agents.
- 2026-09-10: F1 complete, committed (`25b8d06`) — `data/*.json` + `SCHEMA.md`.
- 2026-09-10: A0 complete, committed (`329c3ec`) —
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-10-rules-engine-design.md`.
- 2026-09-10: F2 (engine implementation, 9-step build sequence per the spec's
  §10, each step tested + committed) dispatched as a background agent.
- 2026-09-10: F2 complete — all 9 steps done and committed (`680202d`..`dfb0bf1`).
  `core/rules/*` (catalog, grants, choice, bundles, resolved, resolve, 7 passes,
  effects, power), `core/character.gd`, `core/adapter.gd`, `core/presets.gd`,
  `data/monsters.json`, `data/third-caster-slots.json`, `data/effects/*.json`,
  `tests/test_rules.gd` (499 assertions). Full suite green: hex 66 / combat 597 /
  rules 499. Sheet-built party vs hand-authored: 187W/13L @ 8.4 rounds (93.5%) vs
  186W/14L @ 8.8 (93.0%) — close enough to call re-baselined, not regressed.
  Fixed the two §11 structural debts (combat.gd no longer preloads encounter.gd;
  board is now a required Combat.new arg carrying reach_melee/cone_burning_hands/
  region_at). `Combatant` kept, not replaced — `Adapter.to_combatant` /
  `from_monster` / `write_back` are the seam T7/T8 build on.
  Pushed to origin (`github.com/EgecanOzcakar/sorcmerc`, private).
- 2026-09-10: Phase 2 dispatched — F3 (action economy), T1 (character creator,
  owns the character save/load format), T3 (profile manager, in-memory Character
  input until T1's format lands), T4 (party manager, same caveat) running in
  parallel as background agents. Each instructed not to touch the others' files
  and to report status here rather than editing this doc directly.

This is a multi-week build; phases 0–1 are the critical path and land first.
